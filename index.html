<p>“The purpose of our lives is to be happy. “Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life. Don’t be trapped by dogma which is living with the results of other people’s thinking.There was once a very wise old man who lived on top of a mountain in a village. The villages went to him for advice every time they had a problem. Sometimes, they would come to him complaining about the same problem. One day, Natu, a villager went to the wise man with a problem that was worrying her. The wise man told her a joke, she laughed finding it funny.

   He told the same joke again, she smiled, a bit confused.
   
   After a few minutes, he repeated the same joke and this time, she got annoyed.
   
   The man smiled and said, “You can’t laugh at the same joke over and over. Then why do you cry about the same problem time and again?”There was once a very wise old man who lived on top of a mountain in a village.

   He placed three pots of boiling water on the stove and asked Lea to put an egg into the first, a potato into the second, and tea leaves into the third. He then instructed Lea to keep an eye on all three items for 12 minutes. After 12 minutes, her father takes out the egg, potato, and strains the tea.
   
   He asks Lea to peel the egg and potatoes. Lea is confused as she peels both the egg and potato which had changed since they went into the water. Her father explains, “All the three items were put in the same boiling water but they all reacted differently. The fragile egg came out hard, the tough potato turned soft and the tea leaves changed the water into something beautiful with their aroma and flavour.”
   
   He laughed seeing her confused face “This is how life works.” he said “Life puts everyone in tough situations. It’s up to you to decide how you will come out of it. Now, who are you like? The potato, egg, or tea leaves?” he asked her as she smiled.Once when cooking, Lea’s father decided to use the opportunity to teach his daughter about life’s adversities and how it affects people differently.
